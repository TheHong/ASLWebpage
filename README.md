# ASLWebpage
Webpage used to translate a set of English words to ASL (and Chinese (as a feature)).

First draft was completed in 12 hours (June 9 2020) in the spirit of a half-day hackathon. So this is still a work in progress :)

## Some stuff to be done
- Add documentation (which was not fully done yet due to the ")
- Add the words page (either through linking to a seperate html or by inactivating elements in the home page). The words page will contain all the available words to be translated.
- Add an element in the translation portion that shows the Chinese character
- Add more Chinese characters to allWords.js
- Make it look nicer
